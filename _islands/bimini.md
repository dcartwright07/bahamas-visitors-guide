## Welcome to Bimini

The Bimini Tourist Office extends a warm welcome to you, our guests. We are indeed delighted and grateful that you have chosen to spend your time away from home on our little island, that we consider the ‘gate way’ to our country, and one of the gems of the Islands of the Bahamas. May the embrace of our warm climate and the hospitality of the native Biminites, along with our many indigenous ‘treats and treasures,’ provide such a memorable experience that you will soon return and invite others to join you.
Thank You For Joining Us!
