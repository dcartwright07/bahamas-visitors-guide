## Welcome to Andros

Andros island, the largest of the 26 inhabited Bahamian islands, is geo-politically considered a single island with a land mass greater than all of the other 700 Bahamian islands combined.

The geological make-up of Andros sets it apart from any other place in the world. It is an archipelago within an archipelago nation, dissected by hundreds of creeks and waterways surrounded by hundreds of square miles of fishable flats that are home to permit tarpon and bonefish.

Inland are numerous blue holes surrounded by thousands of acres of virgin forests, teeming with exotic flora, fauna, and wildlife. Here you will find hundreds of species of birds such as the West Indian Woodpecker, the Bahama Mockingbird, and the Red-legged Thrush, just to name a few.

Home of the famous land crabs, the annual harvest season culminates with a grand Crab Festival that lures hundreds of visitors to her shores year after year. For the scuba diver enthusiast interested in seeing the last of the pristine tropical Atlantic reef, Andros is known for its spectacular pristine eco-systems and breathtaking wall dives into the tongue of the ocean.The rich cultural heritage of its people, ranging from Native American Indian to descendants of freed African slaves, provides the visitors with the opportunity of a rich cultural exchange.

The locals refer to Andros as the “Big Yard” - a grand pristine garden where one can escape the pressures of life and experience true adventures of fun in the sun. Whether it is bone fishing, diving, bird watching, or an eco-adventure tour, you are bound to find an activity that suits your purpose. I join all Androsians in welcoming you to explore the magnificent wonders that Andros has to offer.
