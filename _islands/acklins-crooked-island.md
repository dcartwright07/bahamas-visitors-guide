## Welcome to Acklins & Crooked Island

Welcome to Acklins and Crooked Island, gems of the tropical paradise that we call The Islands of The Bahamas.

These islands, nestled in the southern Bahamas, provide secluded solace for the weary traveler. Their warm sunshine, soothing sea waves, and balmy breezes are natural ingredients for the rejuvenation of mind, body, and soul.

The population of these islands consist more of pink flamingoes and an abundance of fish rather than people. However, the small number of people to be encountered will ensure that you have a wonderful time with them. Known for their uncommon humility and their gracious hospitality, the people of Acklins and Crooked Island look forward to making your stay a memorable one.

Enjoy Acklins and Crooked Island, and we hope to see you again in our islands in the near future.
